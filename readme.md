### What is MSociety?
MSociety is a group of Muslim developers in Singapore comprising of students and professionals.
The group comes together with the aim of honing their tech development skills by learning from each other and through developing innovative tech solutions for the community.
MSociety community mostly communicate over [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/PfX0QeDjeMKanjAh) and organises informal gatherings on [Discord](http://msociety.dev/discord).

### Why MSociety?
Tech development is one of the most important skills to have in this time, especially with Singaporeâ€™s aim to be a Smart Nation.
There are also many problems faced by the community that can be solved with tech, however, our community lacks the motivation as well as the talent to create them.

As such, MSociety hopes to be the platform that will assemble the pool of developers together with the purpose of allowing them to learn from each other, and encourage them to be skillful solution creators.

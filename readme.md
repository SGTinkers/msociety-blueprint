# About MSociety

## What is MSociety?
```
MSociety is a group of Muslim youth developers in Singapore.
The group comes together with the aim of honing their tech
development skills by
learning from each other and through developing innovative
tech solutions for the community.
```

## Why MSociety?
```
Tech development is one of the most important skills to have in
this time, especially with Singaporeâ€™s aim to be a Smart Nation.
There are also many problems faced by the community that
can be solved with tech, however, our community lacks the
motivation as well as the talent to create them.
```

```
As such, MSociety hopes to be the platform that will assemble
the pool of youth developers together with the purpose of
allowing them to learn from each other, and encourage them to
be skillful solution creators.
